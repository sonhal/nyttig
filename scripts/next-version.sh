# Prints the next release version (vX.Y.Z) for a commit, or nothing when the

# The bump is the largest one asked for by any commit since the latest stable
# v* tag reachable from rev, read from Conventional Commits subjects
# (https://www.conventionalcommits.org):
#
#   feat: ...                        minor
#   fix: ... / perf: ...             patch
#   type!: ... or a BREAKING CHANGE: major (minor while the version is 0.x)
#   footer in the body
#   anything else (docs:, ci:,       no release
#   chore:, a non-conventional
#   subject, ...)
#
# A scope is allowed (feat(web): ...). Merge commits are skipped; their
# branches' commits are read instead. Pre-release tags (v0.2.0-rc.1) are not
# a baseline: the next stable version is computed from the last stable one.
# Moving to 1.0.0 is a deliberate step: push the v1.0.0 tag by hand.
#
# The reasoning goes to stderr, the version alone to stdout.
